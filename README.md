Architecture

In the full stack project, I used express HTML, JavaScript and single-page applications (SPA). Express HTML creates a simpler structure with separate HTML files for each page. Each user action requires a full page reload. Another difference is that it is much simpler to devlop and maintain. The single-page Application structure is different where as they are built with a component-based architecture, which allows for the application to be divided into reusable parts. The reloads provide a smoother user experience which results in faster interactions once application is loaded. Finally these are much more complex then HTML because they involve handling more client-side logic and ensuring the application state is managed efficiently.
The backend of the Travlr Getaways app used a NoSQL MongoDB database due to flexibility, performance and scalability.
